* My minimal-techno dotfiles set

As times goes by, I find myself in need of only few pieces of system  software.

That is: *StumpWM* for as DE, *tmux* + *zsh* as terminal with colors from
*Xresources*. And *emacs*, but that's another story...

The setup is rough in places, some non-universal settings are hardwired.
I don't care as long as things remain concise and simple.

Inspiration taken from this post:

** TODO future notes
   - +same vim-style window-splitting in tmux and stump+
   - +tmux+
     - +clipboard copy/paste selection+
     - +invoke by default in stump+ Controversial.
   - +correct git prompt in zsh+ I don't need it. Emacs.
